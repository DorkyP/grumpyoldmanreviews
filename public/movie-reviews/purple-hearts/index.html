						<p>Well, here is a surprise. A film with heart and soul and love. And it has two leads with tremendous charisma. These two, Sofia Carson and Nicholas Galitzine, light up the screen. Whenever they are off screen, you are waiting anxiously for their return. This is a rare treat in the cinema of today.</p>
						<p>The story is tight and credible throughout. I won’t reveal the plot as it is complex and needs to be seen by you, the viewer, as a complete awakening. Suffice to say there are enough twists and turns and surprises to keep you glued to the screen.</p>
						<p>The music is great, and the songs are written and performed by the leading lady, Sofia Carson. I’ve never seen her before, but she is up there with the best of them.</p>

						<span class="caption text-muted">It has that familiar "Made for Netflix" sharpness to every shot</span>
						<p>The leading man is one for the ages. He should be signed up immediately by producers all over Hollywood. He is known for his films in Britain, but this film will make his career.</p>
						<p>The direction by Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum, is tight and every frame is perfection.</p>
						<p>The supporting cast are all strong and credible and drive the story forward.</p>
						<p>There not many laughs but there are lots of tears. Old Grumpy wept buckets.</p>
						<p>And there is a beautiful dog. What more could you ask for.</p>
						<p>Short and sweet, tonight, I’m going to sit down and watch it again.</p>
						<p>Thank you, Netflix. This is a winner.</p>
