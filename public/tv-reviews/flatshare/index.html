						<p>Grumpy’s in a good mood. I’ve just watched a delightful piece of British television.</p>
						<p>As it commenced, I thought, ‘Oh bugger!’, I’ve seen this before. And then I thought no that can’t be right, it’s only been released 4 days ago. And then I realized I’d read the novel, and a very fine, fun novel, it is, at that.</p>
						<p>The book and the series have a wonderful premise. Tiffany, [played by Jessica Brown Findlay and remembered from early ‘Downtown Abbey’ episodes.] cash strapped, and recoiling from a failed romance, can’t find accommodation in London, which she can afford. The boy Leon is low on funds and wants to sublet his flat, because he needs money to help his brother who is in prison. Without meeting, they arrange that, as he works at night in a care facility, she should have the flat at night and then she goes to work as a journalist in the daytime, and he comes home and sleeps and lives in the flat in the daytime. The fun thing is they never see each other. Well, that’s the premise. The only connection they have are the post-it notes they leave for each other at the end of each successive session. These, of course, become quite hilarious as problems arise, particularly, the fact that, as there is only one bedroom , they have to share a bed, albeit alone. There is much fun banter about sides of the bed and the laundering of the sheets etc.</p>
						<p>There is a very humorous sequence, when they accidentally meet, inside the flat.</p>
						<p>She is a kooky type of young girl, struggling with her profession. He is very serious, and his personality is quite the opposite of hers. There are lots of friends and work colleagues, who introduce much humour into the proceedings, the patients who Leon cares for at night are each beautifully drawn, and the spurned lover is a wonderfully, over-the-top portrayal, by Bart Edwards.</p>
						<p>Without giving too much away, their story lines become entwined, and all the friends come together for a mutual cause, culminating in an hilarious scene, between the ‘jilted’ ex-lover and a rather large coffee machine.</p>
						<p>Full marks to all concerned. Every performance is spot on, but I will single out, Anthony Welsh, whose low-key portrayal is deeply felt and totally believable. [I remember him from the very excellent ‘The Great’.]</p>
						<p>I’m so happy to bring you such good tidings today. I urge you to watch it.</p>
