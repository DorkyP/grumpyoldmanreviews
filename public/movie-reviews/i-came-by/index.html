						<p>‘Downtown Abbey’ fans beware. Hugh Bonneville, who played the Lord of the Manor for all those years, and only once lapsed from his marital bed, with a chamber maid, has gone over to the dark side.</p>
						<p>Here is a film, a surprise, perhaps, outdoing the great horror films of the 1940s and 1950s.</p>
						<p>Written and directed by Babak Anvan, this has to be the standout film of the year. The camera work, the directing, the acting, the suspense and the climax, all contribute to a great experience for the viewer.</p>
						<p>I don’t intend to go into great detail of the story line or the amazing plot, suffice to say the writing is first rate and everyone involved is to be highly commended.</p>
						<p>Bonneville is superb. I love it when actors break out of their safety mould and create something different. And this creation is way out of left field. As a retired judge, he is evil personified. [You could almost say ‘he was bent’!] He reeks evil, it emanates through his eyes. He is spine chilling. The one scene when he is having a massage from a young man and all we see is his face through the head rest, and his dialogue is so seductive, says it all. This man is Beelzebub. And his one aside to the detective in charge of the case is shattering.</p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="img/a-respectable-gentleman.jpg" alt="A respectable gentleman" />
						<span class="caption text-muted">But he looks so kind and respectable! He even has a cravat!</span>
						<p>Kelly MacDonald, that fine actress, who seems to get younger, instead of older, is superb as the distraught mother of one of the protagonist lads. This is a fine portrayal.</p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="img/diane-from-trainspotting.jpg" alt="Diane from Trainspotting" />
						<span class="caption text-muted">Twin fun facts: 'Trainspotting' came out more than a quarter century ago, and Kelly, who plays the schoolgirl Diane in it, had no formal training whatsoever.</span>
						<p>As the young men, we have that excellent young actor, George Mackay, who is spot on as the graffiti artist targeting the rich and famous. Unfortunately, the story line takes him out of the movie too soon.</p>
						<p>But as his partner, Percelle Ascott, gives a superb performance, showing restraint and loyalty and ultimately great courage as the saviour of the drama. This is a lad we should see more of.</p>
						<p>All the supporting cast are excellent.</p>
						<p>The lighting is so spot on, in this film, along with the cinematography, it dictates the horror of the piece to perfection.</p>

						<span class="caption text-muted">The good guys? Kind of?</span>
						<p>All I can say is see it! I am going to watch it again and again, there is so much to find in it. And don’t ask what’s behind the red door!</p>
						<p>And be warned – don’t let your children see it!</p>
