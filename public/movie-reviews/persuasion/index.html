						<p>Here is a puzzlement of a film [as Yul Brynner would say]. I didn’t know what to make of it. After the first 30 minutes I stopped watching, I thought I’d never seen anything so crude. But after a night’s sleep, I started over from the beginning and must admit, it is a dog’s breakfast, a lot of it is bad, but surprisingly there are some beautiful, lyrical passages which totally embrace Jane Austen.</p>
						<p>This is not an easy Austen novel to film, a previous adaptation, with Amanda Root as Anne, I remember, wasn’t very good either. The heroine has spent 8 years in a dark place having had a breakup with her fiancé, which was brought about by family interference. So, after these two people meet up again, they wander around as two sad looking people trying not to engage with each other. Finally, they both come to their senses and embrace and spend some time in the long grass kissing. Sounds pretty bad doesn’t it.</p>
						<p>When it commenced, I thought I was watching Series three of Bridgerton, [and that was a problem for me.] but after a while I realized the characters names were from Miss Austen’s work. Now I come to think of it – it could have been Bridgerton/3.</p>
						<p>There are some directorial difficulties for me in this film. The director comes from a stage background and thinks she’ll be clever by utilizing the concept of the 4<sup>th</sup> wall, where in the theatre an actor will come out of character and make an aside, a remark to the audience.</p>
						<p>This may work for some viewers, but it left me cold. The actress playing Anne Elliot, smiles and smirks at the camera and makes snide remarks to the camera, I almost expected her to poke out her tongue a la Meghan Markle, at the camera, I understand that’s the in thing at the moment.</p>
						<p>Here is a question, - why do American actresses always seem to play Jane Austen heroines on the screen? Here Anne Elliot is played by Dakota Johnson of ‘Fifty Shades’ fame. For a start I believe she is too old for the part, even if she was jilted 8 years earlier, in Austen’s time that would only make her 26 perhaps at the opening of the film. Dakota looks older, in fact, she looks older than the actress playing Lady Russell, her confidante and companion.</p>
						<p>Cosmo Jarvis, a newcomer to me, plays Frederik Wentworth, the jilted lover and the recent arrival looking around for a mate. Wentworth should be handsome, dashing, charismatic and dynamic. He should take control of the story line and drive it forward. You would never follow this man into battle. This actor has the charisma of a lamp post. No one would wait 8 years for him to come around again. Who casts these things? Likewise, Henry Golding as the other supposed love interest should not be in this role. He could, perhaps, be the best friend of another character but not a pivotal player. Perhaps the director didn’t have much money at her disposal.</p>
						<p>And we have Anne Elliot consuming copious amounts of red wine, from the bottle. Wherever she goes she has a flagon of red wine with her. And the scene where Anne cannot find a place to seat herself at the dinner table is just awful. No one in the society of that time would have been treated like that. There were servants everywhere on hand to seat the guests.</p>
						<p>And to add insult to injury when we are all waiting for the pivotal scene when Anne overhears Captain Wentworth discussing her with Louisa Musgrove, during the long walk, the director has Dakota Johnson, lift her skirts, squat and relieve herself beside a big tree as she hears Wentworth’s and Musgrove’s conversation. Now, I’m sure ladies had to relieve themselves when on those long walks, but I didn’t need to see it. This destroyed what is the central moment of the novel and the viewer has no idea of what has been said by Wentworth and Musgrove.</p>
						<p>But to give the director her due, there are some wonderful moments in the second half of the film, which are quite lyrical and imbue the spirit of Jane Austen’s novel. At these times Dakota Johnson shines. If only the whole film had been up to this standard.</p>
