						<p>I couldn’t catch this one last year as I was in extensive lockdown. As it’s Oscar season again, I thought I would take a look, and see what it was all about.</p>
						<p>An old man [Hopkins] is in a state of mental decline. His daughter, Colman, seems to be in charge of his care, whilst leading a very busy life. The difficulty with this film is to decipher what is real and what is inside the protagonist’s head.</p>
						<p>Hopkins, in an Oscar winning performance, takes us down into the depths of despair, but what is real and what is imagined is the problem for the audience to decide.</p>
						<p>It looks great, beautifully photographed and has an excellent score by Ludivico Einaudi [one of my favourite composers of today]. It also gives us some popular operatic arias, as the father listens to his cassettes. But where is the man? – is he in an aged care facility and is he only imagining the scenes, we witness, or is this taking place in some chronological order.</p>
						<p>The daughter Colman is a problem, I think she is fake and doesn’t really care about her father. She just wants to skip town and live in Paris with her new lover, Rufus Sewell. [Is she Goneril?] It won’t be a problem, she tells the father, I’ll come over for a couple of hours on a Friday night on the train and then go back. Anthony’s not too pleased with this. The boyfriend is a piece of work. Somehow, he seems to be in London a lot of the time, [or is he?] even though he resides in Paris. He drinks a lot of red wine and makes snide remarks to the father. This doesn’t upset the daughter, at all. Anthony is imprisoned in his brain.</p>
						<p>The daughter introduces carers for the father. A charming Imogen Poots tries her hand at it, but Anthony is too clever for her, he charms her and then destroys her. His story of himself as a tap-dancer amuses her, but I couldn’t help thinking, with the upright piano on display throughout, and knowing Sir Anthony is a pianist, why the writers didn’t allow him to play a few bars, in this scene.</p>
						<p>I liked Mark Gatiss as a mysterious man who appears all over the place to berate the father, but, as we see, he really is an orderly at the aged care facility who cares for him. Likewise, Olivia Williams, whom the Father thinks is his daughter, at one point, is the nurse who cares for him in the facility.</p>
						<p>So, the Father is in the facility, throughout the course of the story and all the preceding scenes are inside his head and come out in a jumble of demented thoughts. I’m glad I got that sorted out!</p>
						<p>At one point he imagines his other daughter, the one he loved, his ‘Cordelia’ is dead in an horrific way. But is she?</p>
						<p>Hopkins is fine throughout and certainly has more screen time than in his previous Oscar winning portrayal in ‘Silence of the Lambs’.</p>
						<p>I must tell you I don’t like Olivia Colman as an actress, even though she is the darling of the awards fraternity. She only has to put a foot on the screen to win an Oscar, an Emmy, a Golden Globe or a Bafta. If she sang, I’m sure she’d win a Grammy! [As a matter of fact, I saw her in a strange film, where she oversaw some sort of correction facility, and she sang in that. If it was her voice, she’s not bad.] If she is meant to be unlikeable as the daughter, she succeeds.</p>
						<p>As an aside, the institution she puts him in resembles a Victorian prison. Watching Hopkins in this, I was reminded of his ‘King Lear’ which I saw on Marquee TV from London, some time ago.</p>
						<p>Here was dementia and madness to the nth degree. And he had to cope with two daughters who tried to put him away. Emma Thomson was an icy Goneril and Emily Watson was a very tough Regan. Hopkins had a ball, raging in the storm on the Heath, sinking lower into madness with every scene. Arriving in Dover, he finally grabs a supermarket trolley and goes into the IGA store and buys his fruit and vegies. By this time, he’s as mad as a meat-axe. It’s great stuff, well worth a look.</p>
