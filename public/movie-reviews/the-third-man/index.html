						The Third Man
						Directed by Carol Reed
						From a story by Graham Greene
						1949
						Joseph Cotton
						Valli
						Trevor Howard
						Orson Welles
						Black and white
						Zither music by Anton Karas
						Oh, what a joy to re-visit one of my favourite films of all time.
						Although not the best print I could find [rented from Youtube] it still brought back all the
						beauty and excitement of the original.
						Set in post-war Vienna, which is a city in ruins and divided into 4 sectors - British, American,
						Russian and French, it tells the story of a corrupt gang of men defrauding hospital drug
						supplies, and selling drugs on the black market, and consequently murdering and maiming
						patients in the process. Led by the charismatic Harry Lime, Orson Welles, the group are
						constantly under surveillance and Lime fakes his own death in order to take the heat out of
						his nefarious activities.
						Enter, his best friend from America, Holly Martins, played by Joseph Cotton, who arrives on
						the day of Lime’s ‘funeral’, and the scene is set for 90 minutes of film noir magic. Joseph
						Cotton was never better.
						A great cast is assembled by Reed and Selznick, the producer. Trevor Howard, a great
						character actor, is gruff and stern as the British commander, ably supported by that fine
						English actor Bernard Lee.
						Valli, who when Selznick brought her to Hollywood, was known as Alida Valli, has now been
						reduced to the single Valli for credit purposes. It was thought to be more exotic. You will
						remember her from Alfred Hitchcock’s ‘The Paradine Case’.
						Some great cameos are given by a wealth of European actors and Wilfred Hyde-Whyte
						almost steals the show as an eccentric Englishman who presents cultural evenings for
						displaced Britishers.
						
						The cinematography by Robert Krasker is outstanding and in many ways is the star of the
						film. Low camera angles reveal darkened streets and grotesque shadows as the camera
						moves through the city. The finale, which takes place in the sewers below Vienna, is a broad
						palette of light and shade against the rushing waters, juxtaposed with darkened stairs and
						ladders. The shadow of a balloon seller approaching in the darkened streets is a beautiful
						moment and the memorable final image of Lime’s hands through the sewer grating at street
						level, with a breeze blowing, is one to haunt you for years to come.
						Harry Lime’s first entrance with his cat is one of cinemas legends and when the light from an
						upstairs window hits his face, we see everything we need to know about the man. Welles at
						his best.
						The famous ferris-wheel scene is similarly gripping. Will Harry throw his friend out of the
						carriage, or will they descend to the ground?
						Lime runs a lot of the time, and the camera is always on his heels.
						Valli as Anna Schmidt, Lime’s mistress, is torn between her love for him and her disquiet at
						his profession. However, love wins out and she tries to save him to the end. Martins, is
						obviously attracted to her, but she doesn’t want any of that. However, there is a
						psychological quirk happening throughout as Anna keeps referring to Holly as Harry.
						The final shot is the stuff of legends. We finally have Harry Lime’s funeral. Anna and Holly
						are in attendance. Holly thinks he may still have some hope with Anna, and he stands at the
						cemetery gate as she starts to leave. She walks, in a great long shot from the grave to the
						gates. Will she acknowledge Holly? Will Holly be able to offer some comfort? No, Anna
						walks straight to the camera and passes Holly by. A great ending.
						The music score by Anton Karas, must be mentioned. Never has a score been so associated
						with a film as in this case.
						The film was lauded all over the world, except in Vienna. To this day, the Viennese do not
						want to be reminded of that time in their history. Although, there is one small cinema in
						that city which, to this day, shows ‘The Third Man’ twice a week.
						I first saw this film in 1949 and have seen it many times since. It truly is a classic.
						4/5 [Should have been 5/5, but, as I said, a very inferior print from Youtube.]
