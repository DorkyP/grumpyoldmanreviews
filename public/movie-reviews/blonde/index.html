						<p>Oh dear, Oh dear! Where does one begin. There must be something in the water at the Venice Film Festival, last year they gave us ‘The Power of the Dog’ [a shocker] and this year they’ve given us ‘Blonde’. [It’s the curate’s egg – good in parts].</p>
						<p>The director Dominik admits he doesn’t admire Monroe, can’t imagine why anyone would watch her movies [I do] and he only made it because it was about a woman who committed suicide. [the jury is still out on that one.]</p>
						<p>He obviously doesn’t respect her in any way and sets out to dehumanise her in most of the film. However, there are some very fine scenes where the greatness of Monroe shines through. I applaud him for this.</p>
						<p>The casting is excellent throughout, de Armas is very good [however I did think I was watching Lady Gaga at times, I don’t know why.] Adrien Brody is splendid as Arthur Miller; however, he did come across as a caricature of Woody Allen [I’m not sure if that was intentional.] Bobby Cannavale is very strong as Di Maggio, we know he was the man who truly loved her but couldn’t take the exploitation she was subjected to by the studio and the public. There is a superb portrayal of Norma Jean’s mother by Julianne Nicholson. [I can see a supporting actress nomination here.]</p>
						<p>The early scenes of the young Norma Jean are harrowing, and rightly so. The child played by Lily Fisher, is also excellent. When Norma Jean becomes Marilyn, she is exploited by studio heads and the system, sex is often the price for a role, in many cases rape, and there are graphic representations of this. There are some strange time lapses in the narrative. For example, we would be led to think that ‘All About Eve’ was her first film, but she had a string of movies behind her by that time, including the excellent appearance in ‘Asphalt Jungle’.</p>
						<p>Dominik uses an interesting device where he takes an actual scene from one of her movies and inserts De Armas into the scene.</p>
						<p>The menage a trois with the two young men is well depicted but the subsequent pregnancy and abortion scenes are over the top. Never have so many medicos been present at an abortion, but I assume this was in Marilyn’s mind as was the subsequent recurring performance from the animated foetus, which crops up again and again, chatting with Marilyn.</p>
						<p>The director is at his best in the re-enactment of the scene with the razor blade from ‘Don’t Bother to Knock’. Here he is paying homage to one of Marilyn’s finest acting outings. De Armas is splendid here. I could have taken more of this.</p>
						<p>She is exploited continually, the studio making her play ‘Gentlemen Prefer Blondes’ for $5,000 whilst her co-star [and inferior co-star] Jane Russell was paid $100,000.</p>
						<p>She meets Di Maggio, and he loves her very dearly, they marry and honeymoon in New York, but it is that city which would bring an end to the marriage. Dominik recreates the air from the subway scene from ‘The Seven Year Itch’, on the streets of New York at night, where Marilyn’s frock is blown up over her body and sometimes over her head, with just her underwear on display. He shows a howling mob of men devouring her with their eyes and screaming at her for an extended period. Surely even the studio would not have allowed that to happen. Di Maggio is in the crowd and is not happy, he makes that known to her the moment she comes back to their hotel. He belts her senseless. That is the end of the marriage, yet he loved her until the day she died.</p>
						<p>We then see her attending the Actors’ Studio In New York. She’s in a class where she and a group of students read from a work by Arthur Miller, who is in attendance. Now Dominik does not let us see her perform in this workshop, I don’t know why. Here would be an opportunity for her to display her talents, as she did with the ‘Don’t Bother to Knock‘ scene. However, this leads to the most beautiful scene in the film. Marilyn and Miller meet after the class, and he tells her how beautifully she read his work and they go to a café and talk about theatre and the arts. She tells of her love for the Russian authors, particularly Chekhov and he is astounded by her depth of feeling for literature. This scene alone is worth the price of admission.</p>
						<p>Then the director bypasses her two great triumphs, ‘Bus Stop’ and ‘The Prince and the Showgirl’, perhaps because she was at the height of her powers and was totally in charge of her project, particularly with ‘The Prince and the Showgirl’. He didn’t intend us see her at her best.</p>
						<p>She finds she is pregnant again with Arthur Miller and she commences to speak to her foetus again, however an accident on the beach brings her dream of motherhood to an end.</p>
						<p>Then it’s downhill all the way, from hereon in. She seems to become more drug addicted, she is a total wreck on the set of ‘Some Like it Hot’ and doctors are on hand injecting her with something to get her on her feet and back on the set. A funny aside to this is that Billy Wilder said he would never work with her again after ‘The Seven Year Itch’ but he put himself through it again with ‘Some Like it Hot’.</p>
						<p>The last hour of the film is a disaster. I think Mr. Dominik ran out of ways to show she was being exploited. It’s all out of focus shots, Marilyn in a coma-like state and at one point being delivered to John F Kennedy’s bedroom, not to sing, ‘Happy Birthday’ but to give him a blow job. And the director shows it all. I’m sure this is where many viewers switch off.</p>
						<p>We then amble through artistic camerawork and a lot of music, forgetting that she made two more films and a half of one before her demise. The death is very strange indeed. In fact, I didn’t realize we were witnessing her death. We don’t see her on a bed or anywhere for that matter under the influence of narcotics. Yes, she appears out of her mind, she has a strange encounter with a delivery boy and then there is a quick out of focus shot of what could be a leg and a foot hanging over the edge of the bed. Then it is said that she is dead. I felt we could, at least, have had Peter Lawford run in to check her pulse to make sure she was truly gone.</p>
						<p>As stated above, good in parts. The good parts are very good indeed. I would love this director to have taken a more balanced approach. Yes, it’s about a girl who commits suicide [or did she?], but his subject is worth more than that and I think this man could have delivered it.</p>
						<p>I’ve just had an idea for Netflix, which, I understand, isn’t doing too well at the moment. Why not buy Marilyn’s ‘Bus Stop’ and stream it on your channel. Then the world could see what a genius Monroe was! Just a thought.</p>
